## Setup and Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/solarscope.git
    cd solarscope
    ```
    *(Replace `your-username/solarscope.git` with your actual repository URL)*

2.  **API Keys:** This project requires API keys from several services.
    *   Obtain API keys from:
        *   [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/appid)
        *   [OpenCageData](https://opencagedata.com/api#api-key)
        *   [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/signup.aspx)
        *   *(SunriseSunset.io does not currently require a key for basic use)*
    *   Locate the `apikeys.example.js` file in the project root.
    *   **Rename** or **copy** this file to `apikeys.js`.
    *   Open `apikeys.js` and replace the placeholder strings (`"YOUR_..._KEY_HERE"`) with your actual API keys obtained from the services above.
    *   **Important:** The `apikeys.js` file is listed in `.gitignore` and should **never** be committed to version control.

3.  **Open the Application:**
    *   Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
    *   **Note:** For full functionality (especially API requests), it's recommended to serve the files using a simple local web server to avoid potential CORS issues when running directly from `file:///`. Tools like the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension for VS Code or Python's built-in server (`python -m http.server` in the project directory) can be used.

## Usage

1.  **Enter a location** in the search bar at the top. Suggestions will appear as you type. Click a suggestion to load its data.
2.  Alternatively, **enable map interaction** using the toggle switch above the map and click directly on the map to select a location.
3.  View the **current sun times, weather conditions, and forecasts** displayed in the cards below the map/weather section.
4.  Click the **"Add to Favorites"** button (within the "Today's Information" card) to save the currently displayed location.
5.  View, load, or remove saved locations from the **"Your Favorites"** card.
6.  Use the **theme toggle button** (moon/sun icon) in the header to switch between light and dark modes.
7.  Use the **"Auto Update"** toggle below the search bar to enable/disable automatic data refreshing for the current location.
8.  Click the **"Clear"** button next to the search bar to reset the input and displayed data.
